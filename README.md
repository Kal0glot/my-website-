        Table Tennis is a fast and dynamic sport where two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small paddles. The goal is to make the ball land on the opponent’s side of the table in a way that they cannot return it according to the rules.
        The game requires quick reflexes, good hand–eye coordination, and smart strategy. Table tennis is played on a rectangular table divided by a small net in the center. The ball used in the game is very light, which makes its speed and spin important elements of play. Players use different types of strokes, such as topspin, backspin, and smashes, to outplay their opponents. A point begins with a serve, where the server must toss the ball upward and strike it so it bounces once on their side and then on the opponent’s side. Matches are usually played to 11 points, and a player must win by at least two points. Table tennis is known for its fast rallies, where the ball can reach extremely high speeds despite its small size. Professional players train to react within fractions of a second. The sport is played both recreationally and competitively around the world. It is also an Olympic sport, first included in the 1988 Summer Olympics. Table tennis is popular because it doesn’t require much space and can be played indoors all year round. Many people enjoy it as a fun activity that improves coordination, reflexes, and focus.

            <p>Table tennis is one of the fastest sports in the world; the ball can reach speeds of over 100 km/h in professional matches. It originated in England in the late 19th century as an indoor alternative to lawn tennis. The smallest mistakes matter a lot—games are often decided by fractions of a second. Spin is very important: the same stroke can behave completely differently depending on the spin applied. Table tennis is played by millions worldwide and has been an Olympic sport since 1988. Surprisingly, it is also used as a training tool in other sports to improve reflexes and hand–eye coordination.</p>
